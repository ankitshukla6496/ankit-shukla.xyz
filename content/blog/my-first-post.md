Welcome to my blog! I'm Ankit, a developer who loves building things on the web.

## Why Start a Blog?

I've always believed that writing is one of the best ways to solidify your understanding of a topic. When you try to explain something clearly, you quickly discover the gaps in your own knowledge.

This blog is my space to:

- Share what I'm learning
- Document projects I'm working on
- Think through technical problems in public

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Web development** — React, Next.js, Node.js, and the broader JavaScript ecosystem
- **Tools and workflows** — Things that make development faster and more enjoyable
- **Project walkthroughs** — Behind-the-scenes looks at how I build things

## Let's Connect

If you find something useful here, or if you want to chat about a topic, feel free to reach out through the [contact page](/contact) or find me on GitHub.

Thanks for reading, and welcome aboard.
